**Hackathon Edition ‚Äì October 2025**
**Prepared by:** Esabu Blessing
**North Star Metric:** Launch the **Afrobeats Economic Heat Index (AEHI)** for 10 artists

---

## **1. Overview**

**GbeduFlow** is an AI-powered platform that measures the *grassroots hype* and *global reach* of Nigerian artists.
It combines student-submitted ratings and lightweight audience clustering to produce the **Afrobeats Economic Heat Index (AEHI)** ‚Äî a single score that quantifies both local traction and export readiness.

The platform empowers:

* **Students (fans)** ‚Üí to hype local artists and join campus challenges.
* **Artists** ‚Üí to measure and showcase their traction.
* **Promoters/Policymakers** ‚Üí to visualize data-driven heat trends in music.

---

## **2. Problem & Solution**

### Problem

* Local buzz isn‚Äôt being tracked or quantified.
* Artists lack insight into how their audience grows across regions.
* Promoters and sponsors make decisions without reliable data.

### Solution

* **Local Demand Score (LDS):** Captures organic hype from campus submissions.
* **Audience Export Index (AEI):** Clusters audience text to reveal international interest.
* **AEHI (Main Metric):** Combines both into one interpretable 0‚Äì100 score.

## **4. Core MVP Features**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Artist Onboarding

Artists can register with their name, genre, and one YouTube/TikTok link.
‚Üí *Backend:* `/api/artists` route
‚Üí *Frontend:* Simple form page

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Student ‚ÄúVibe Check‚Äù

Students rate artists (1‚Äì5) and select their campus.
‚Üí *Backend:* `/api/submissions` route
‚Üí *Frontend:* One-page rating UI

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ AEHI Engine
